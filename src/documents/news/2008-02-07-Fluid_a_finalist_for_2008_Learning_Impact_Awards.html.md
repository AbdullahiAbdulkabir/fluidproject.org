The Fluid Project has been selected as a finalist for the IMS Global Learning Consortium's 2008 Learning Impact Awards, recognizing high impact use of technology in support of learning.

The LIA awards program is unique in that it recognizes learning innovation both in terms of the technology used and the educational organization that has utilized it for high impact, capturing the essential elements of innovation, adoption, and learning. The 25 finalists include 14 from outside the United States. Three finalists were in the research category, eight in the new category, and thirteen in the established category. The Fluid Project was nominated in the Research category.

The winners will be selected at the Learning Impact 2008 conference in Austin, Texas in May, 2008.
