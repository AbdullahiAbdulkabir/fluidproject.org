<h3>What is Fluid?</h3>

The Fluid component library is a small but growing collection of rich,  reusable, accessible user interface components that can be used across  web applications. These components have been designed by a  cross-disciplinary team and thoroughly tested for usability and  accessibility. By incorporating Fluid components into your web  application's user interface, you can make your application easier to  use by more people. Easier to use means happier users. 

<h3>Fluid is Open Source</h3>

Fluid's source code is dual licensed under the ECL 2.0 and BSD licenses.  Our UX Toolkit is available under a Creative Commons license.

<h3>Known Issues </h3>
Fluid is still in early development, and this release has a number of  known issues. API changes will be coming in the future, so for now, we  encourage you to use 0.1 for experimentation and prototyping. Check the  README.txt file in the download package for a list of known issues. 

Thanks to everyone in the community for their hard work on this release!
