The Fluid team is hosting a U-Camp at the <a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/news/unconference2007.html">JA-SIG Winter 2007 Unconference</a> during the week of November 12. This will be an opportunity for members of the User Experience (UX) community to get together in a face-to-face environment to share Design and User Interaction knowledge with interested members of the JA-SIG community.

In the spirit of unconferences, planning for the U-Camp is a participatory and interactive process. For evolving details regarding time, place, and activities go the <a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/JCON/U-Camp+Planning+-+JA-Sig+UnConference">U-Camp planning wiki page</a> and the <a href="http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/JCON/Winter+2007+UnConference+Scheduling+Grid">Unconference Scheduling Grid</a>.
