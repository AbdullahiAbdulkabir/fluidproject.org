<h3>Check out Fluid Engage's 0.3 mobile application: My Collection</h3>

You can see Fluid Engage's latest mobile work on our <a href="http://build.fluidproject.org:8095/engage/home/home.html">nightly build site</a>.  This site is the most up-to-date code we've written. View the page in a Safari web browser or from a mobile phone browser.

It's cutting edge development, so some of the features won't be visible until we closer to the February 15th implementation of the application at the <a href="http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/">McCord Museum of Canadian History</a>.

The McCord Museum will be using a kit of iPod touches from Apple Computer to test, evaluate, and conduct user tests on Fluid Engage 0.3 My Collection. The applications will allow the museum visitors to do the following:

<ul>
   <li>choose whether content will appear in French or English</li>
   <li>browse featured and permanent exhibitions</li>
   <li>type in an object code and see particular artifacts' pages</a></li>
   <li>collect artifacts into a personalized "My Collection"</li>
   <li>email themselves their "My Collection"</li>
 </ul>
