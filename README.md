# Fluid Project Website

This repository contains the files needed to build a copy of the Fluid Project website.

## Requirements

Download and install the following packages before building the Fluid website:

* docpad installed - https://docpad.org/
* docpad handlebars plugin - https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-handlebars/
* moment plugin - https://www.npmjs.org/package/docpad-plugin-moment
* markdown plugin - https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-marked
* sass plugin - https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-sass
* eco plugin - https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-eco


## How to Build for Local Development

1. Clone the fluid website repository
        > git clone <fluid-website-git-repo>
2. Run docpad from the fluid-website directory
        > cd fluidproject.org
        > docpad run
   There should be output similar to this:
        info: Generated 377/379 files in 13.422 seconds
        info: Watching setup starting...
        info: Watching setup
        info: The action completed successfully
3. Open http://localhost:9778/ to see the website.

**Note:** docpad runs its own webserver for development. To create a deployable version of the website, see "Building a Deployable Version" below.

## Building a Deployable Version

1. To build a deployable version of the website, run:
        > docpad generate
2. Copy the files located in ``/fluidproject.org/out/`` to your web server.

**Note:** The website needs to be deployed into the root directory of the target domain. Otherwise the navigation will not work.

## Other Notes for Developers

* It is strongly recommended to work from source files located within the ``fluidproject.org/src/`` directory. Do not work from the ``fluidproject.org/out/`` directory as these files get overwritten by docpad.
* There is no need to version the ``/fluidproject.org/out/`` directory. This removes ambiguity as to which files to work from.
